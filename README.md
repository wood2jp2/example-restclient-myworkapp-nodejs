# Example REST Client My Work App: Node.js
This project contains source code for a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) web application that interacts with ServiceNow's [REST APIs](https://docs.servicenow.com/integrate/inbound_rest/concept/c_RESTAPI.html) including a [Scripted REST API](https://docs.servicenow.com/integrate/custom_web_services/concept/c_CustomWebServices.html). The simple use case is a "MyWork" application which displays a user's current tasks and allows comments to be added. This application demonstrates how to build the MyWork app using Node.js. To see the same use case implemented in iOS, see [Example REST Client My Work App: iOS](https://github.com/ServiceNow/example-restclient-myworkapp-ios).

## Architecture
Here is an overview of the MyWork application architecture. Note both this Node.js application and the iOS application are represented in the diagram.
![Architecture diagram](/images/arch_diagram.jpg "Architecture diagram")

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Prerequisites
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed
* A ServiceNow instance ([Geneva Patch 3](https://docs.servicenow.com/release_notes/r_Geneva-Patch-3.html) or later).
	* **Don't have a ServiceNow instance?** Get one **FREE** by signing up at https://developer.servicenow.com
	* Not sure what version of ServiceNow your instance is running?  [Determine running version](http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Upgrades_Best_Practices#Prepare_for_Upgrading)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Install the Node.js project on your host. This could be your laptop or a server where you have installed Node.js.
1. Clone the project and install dependencies
	* Git clone
	```bash
	$ git clone https://github.com/ServiceNow/example-restclient-myworkapp-nodejs.git
	$ cd example-restclient-myworkapp-nodejs
	$ npm install
	```
	--or--
	* [Download](https://github.com/ServiceNow/example-restclient-myworkapp-nodejs/archive/master.zip) the full project as a Zip file
	```bash
	<unzip>
	$ cd example-restclient-myworkapp-nodejs
	$ npm install
	```
2. Install the **MyWork Update Set** in your ServiceNow instance. This is a ServiceNow scoped application which contains the **Task Tracker API** Scripted REST API and related files. Note you must be an admin of your ServiceNow instance to install update sets.
	1. Obtain the "My Work" update set
		* Download the update set from [share.servicenow.com](https://share.servicenow.com/app.do#/detailV2/e43cf2f313de5600e77a36666144b0b4/overview)
<br/>--or--
		* Get the update set from the directory where you cloned the GitHub repository: **example-restclient-myworkapp-nodejs/mywork_update_set/sys_remote_update_set_2f48a7d74f4652002fa02f1e0210c785.xml**
	2. Install the Update Set XML
		1. In your ServiceNow instance, navigate to **Retrieved Update Sets**
		2. Click **Import Update Set from XML**
		3. Click **Choose File**, browse to find the downloaded update set XML file from Step 1, and click **Upload**
		4. Click to open the **My Work** update set
		5. Click **Preview Update Set**
		6. Click **Commit Update Set**
	3. Verify the MyWork Update Set installed using the API Explorer
		1. In your ServiceNow instance, navigate to **Scripted REST APIs**
		2. Open the **Task Tracker** Scripted REST API, then open the **My Tasks** API resource
		3. Click **Explore REST API** (this opens the API in the REST API Explorer)
		4. In the API Explorer, click **Send** and verify the API request is sent and receives a **200-OK** response

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Running the Node.js application
Start the Node.js server
```bash
$ cd example-restclient-myworkapp-nodejs
$ node server.js
Server listening on: http://localhost:3000

```

By default the Node application will listen for requests on localhost port 3000. Navigate your web browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should see the login screen for the My Work application.

To run the server on a different port, use the `--port=xxxx` option
```bash
$ node server.js --port=8080
Server listening on: http://localhost:8080
```

To print the usage, use --help
```bash
$ node server.js --help

Usage: node server.js [ -h ] [ -p <port> ] [ -v ]
   -h, --help                  Show this usage help
   -p <port>, --port=<port>    HTTP server listen port (default 3000)
   -v, --verbose               Verbose HTTP output
$
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

## About the application
In this application, the web browser is the client, which makes HTTP calls to the Node.js server 'server.js' to get task details.

Server side, the Node application uses the **Task Tracker** Scripted REST API to get the list of tasks assigned to the logged-in user. Dispatchers handle interaction between Node and the ServiceNow instance.

### Functional flow

#### 1. Login
![Login](/images/login.png)

After starting the Node.js web server, navigate your browser to http://localhost:3000. You're presented with a login page where you need to input your ServiceNow instance name (e.g. if your instance URL is https://myinstance.service-now.com, then enter `myinstance` into the Instance text box).

Enter the user ID and password for a user on the instance. This application uses Basic Authentication to manage user authentication against the ServiceNow REST API. When a user enters credentials, an HTTP POST call is made to the `/login` endpoint of the Node.js server), which internally establishes a session to the REST API.

**NOTE**: The application makes all REST API calls from the Node.js server side, as opposed to client side from the web browser. You can imagine this application could also be refactored such that the API calls would be made from the client (i.e. AJAX), but that was not the intention of this example application.

On successful login, the user is directed to the `/tasks` endpoint. On failure, the user is directed to the login page to reenter credentials.

After login, the application displays the tasks assigned to the user grouped by task type. The application is using the **Task Tracker API** to retrieve the list of tasks from ServiceNow. The logged in user must have access to view these tasks (e.g., Incidents, Problems, Tickets) for them to be returned in the REST API and subsequently displayed in the 'MyWork App'.

**> REST API Call:** Get user details (Table API)
```
GET /api/now/v2/table/sys_user?user_name=john.doe
```

#### 2. View my tasks
![Task List](/images/task_list.png)

Click an item in the list to open the task details.

**> REST API Call:** Get my tasks (Task Tracker API)
```
GET /api/x_snc_my_work/v1/tracker/task
```

#### 3. View task detail/add comment
![Task Details](/images/task_detail.png)

Comments can be added to a task and will appear on the work notes for the task both in this application as well as within ServiceNow.

**> REST API Calls:** Get comments, Add comment (Task Tracker API, Table API)
```
GET /api/now/v2/table/sys_journal_field?element_id=<task_id>

POST /api/x_snc_my_work/v1/tracker/task/{task_id}/comment
{"comment":"Hello, world!"}
```

![App Flow](/images/node_flow.png)


### Client side
On the client side, the application uses [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) for client side scripting and interaction with the Node.js server. Each page is associated with an [Angular controller](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/controller).

| Page	| Controller	|		Details |
|---------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| login.html 	| [loginController.js](/public/js/loginController.js)	|	Collect user instance and credentials	|
| task_list.html	| [taskListController.js](/public/js/taskListController.js)	|	List of tasks assigned to the user |
| task_detail.html	| [taskDetailController.js](/public/js/taskDetailController.js)	|	Details of a single task, view and add comments |

### Server side
The Node JS server has 2 components: dispatchers and sn_api module.
* Dispatchers (`<this repo>/dispatcher`)
	* Dispatch calls to ServiceNow REST API endpoints using the sn_api module. The 2 dispatchers used by this app are detailed below
* **sn_api** module (`<this repo>/sn_api`)
	* Encapsulate the details of sending REST API calls to ServiceNow

`loginDispatcher.js`: handles user authentication. The dispatcher handles calls reaching /login endpoint of Node.js server.

|Node endpoint| HTTP Method |Details|
|--------|--------|--------|
|/login  | POST |	Uses the REST Table API to query for user details from the sys_user table (`GET /api/now/v2/table/sys_user`) in ServiceNow. |

`taskDispatcher.js`: handles any task related interaction with ServiceNow instance. The dispatcher handles calls to 3 endpoints.

| Node endpoint |	HTTP Method | Details |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| /tasks | GET | Uses the **Task Tracker** Scripted REST API to get tasks assigned to a user (`GET /api/x_snc_my_work/v1/tracker/task`)|
| /tasks/:task/comments| GET | Uses the REST Table API to query for a task's work notes from the sys_journal_field table (`GET /api/now/v2/table/sys_journal_field`) |
| /tasks/:task/comments | POST | Uses the **Task Tracker** Scripted REST API to add a comment (work note) to a task (`POST /api/x_snc_my_work/v1/tracker/task/{task_id}/comment`) |


### Session management
Two types of sessions are managed by the application, between:
* Browser and Node.js web application
* Node.js server and ServiceNow instance

When a user enters credentials on the login page, the browser POSTs them to the `/login` endpoint of the Node.js server. The Node.js server creates a session object and makes an HTTP GET to the REST Table API to retrieve the sys_user record from ServiceNow.

If the request is successful then a session is automatically created on ServiceNow and the response contains cookies that can be used to bind to the same session. These cookies are stored in the session object in Node.js. On subsequent calls to ServiceNow REST endpoints, the cookies are retrieved from the session object and applied to outgoing requests.

To process a logout, an HTTP DELETE call is made to the `/logout` endpoint, in which the session object is deleted for the user.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Sample REST API requests/responses

### 1. Login/retrieve user account
The initial request to ServiceNow submits the user credentials and retrieves the user account. This establishes a session with ServiceNow which can be maintained by saving and resending the cookies returned from the first request.

Here is an equivalent sample curl request. It saves the response cookies in a new file called cookies.txt. The same file is specified on subsequent request in order to apply all cookies.
```
$ curl --verbose --request GET \
--header "Accept: application/json" \
--user "john.doe:password" --cookie cookies.txt --cookie-jar cookies.txt \
 "https://myinstance.service-now.com/api/now/v2/table/sys_user?user_name=john.doe&sysparm_fields=user_name,first_name,last_name,sys_id"

> GET /api/now/v2/table/sys_user?user_name=john.doe&sysparm_fields=user_name,first_name,last_name,sys_id HTTP/1.1
> Authorization: Basic am9obi5kb2U6cGFzc3dvcmQ=

    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Get user's tasks
Next, the user's tasks are retrieved. Note how the cookies from the first request are sent with subsequent requests, and user credentials no longer need to be sent:
```
$ curl --verbose --request GET \
--header "Accept: application/json" \
--cookie cookies.txt --cookie-jar cookies.txt \
 "https://myinstance.service-now.com/api/x_snc_my_work/v1/tracker/task"
